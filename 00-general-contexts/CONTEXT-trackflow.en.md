# TrackFlow Logistics

TrackFlow Logistics is a last-mile logistics and warehouse management company founded in 2009 in Miami, Florida. It operates in five markets — the United States, Spain, Mexico, Chile, and Brazil — and combines three lines of service: warehouse management for e-commerce brands selling across multiple countries, last-mile delivery (the final leg from warehouse to end customer), and reverse logistics (returns and product reconditioning). The company has approximately 380 employees and generates around 42 million dollars in annual revenue.

Its clients are fashion, consumer electronics, and cosmetics brands that sell online across Latin America and Europe, and that outsource their entire logistics operation to TrackFlow. The company grew very quickly between 2020 and 2023 driven by the e-commerce boom, but that growth left behind an uneven technological infrastructure: each country runs on different systems, data does not flow between operations, and the leadership team makes decisions based on information that arrives late and fragmented. Margins are shrinking because competitors are automating what TrackFlow still does by hand.

CEO Andrew Espinoza has created an internal unit called **TrackFlow Tech** to lead the company's digital transformation. The company's five main challenges are: achieving unified, real-time visibility of inventory across all warehouses; consolidating package tracking from more than 40 different carriers; automating the management of returns (which represent up to 28% of total volume); offering 24/7 customer support in three languages; and equipping the leadership team with comparable data across countries to support strategic decision-making.

The differentiating factor that sets TrackFlow apart is its multinational complexity: five countries, three languages, five currencies, different legal frameworks, and time zones that stretch from Madrid to São Paulo.
